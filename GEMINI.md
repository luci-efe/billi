# SpecSafe — Two-Phase Workflow Rules

SpecSafe is a two-phase software engineering framework. Phase 1 (Planning) reduces ambiguity before implementation. Phase 2 (Development) enforces strict test-driven execution through small spec slices. No stage may be skipped. Each stage has a dedicated skill and persona.

## Phase 1: Planning

Planning precedes development. Each step produces an artifact that informs the next.

| Step | Skill | What Happens |
|------|-------|--------------|
| 1 | `specsafe-brainstorm` | Divergent exploration of possibilities |
| 2 | `specsafe-principles` | Product principles, non-goals, quality priorities |
| 3 | `specsafe-brief` | Concise product/business framing document |
| 4 | `specsafe-prd` | Testable requirements with user journeys and acceptance criteria |
| 5 | `specsafe-ux` | UX design: tokens, components, flows, accessibility |
| 6 | `specsafe-architecture` | System architecture with ADRs and technology decisions |
| 7 | `specsafe-readiness` | Pre-development coherence check |

Canonical order: brainstorm → principles → brief → PRD → UX → architecture → readiness. UX always precedes architecture.

## Phase 2: Development Stages

| Stage | Skill | Persona | What Happens |
|-------|-------|---------|--------------| 
| SPEC | `specsafe-new`, `specsafe-spec` | Mason (Kai) | Create and refine specification with requirements and scenarios |
| TEST | `specsafe-test` | Forge (Reva) | Generate test files from spec scenarios (all tests fail) |
| CODE | `specsafe-code` | Bolt (Zane) | Implement code using TDD red-green-refactor |
| QA | `specsafe-verify`, `specsafe-qa` | Warden (Lyra) | Validate tests pass, check coverage, generate QA report |
| COMPLETE | `specsafe-complete` | Herald (Cass) | Human approval gate, move to completed |

## Key Files

- **`PROJECT_STATE.md`** — Single source of truth for all spec status and metrics. Read this first.
- **`specs/active/`** — Active spec markdown files
- **`specs/completed/`** — Completed specs with QA reports
- **`specs/archive/`** — Archived/obsolete specs
- **`specsafe.config.json`** — Project configuration (test framework, language, tools)

## Skills Reference

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `specsafe-init` | Initialize a new SpecSafe project with directory structure and config |
| `specsafe-explore` | Pre-spec research, spikes, and feasibility assessment |
| `specsafe-brief` | Create a concise product brief |
| `specsafe-prd` | Expand brief into full PRD with user journeys and requirements |
| `specsafe-ux` | UX design foundations — tokens, components, accessibility, flows |
| `specsafe-architecture` | System architecture — components, data model, ADRs |
| `specsafe-new <name>` | Create a new spec from template with unique ID |
| `specsafe-spec <id>` | Refine an existing spec with requirements and scenarios |
| `specsafe-test <id>` | Generate test files from spec scenarios (SPEC → TEST) |
| `specsafe-code <id>` | Implement code via TDD to pass tests (TEST → CODE) |
| `specsafe-verify <id>` | Run tests and validate against spec (CODE → QA) |
| `specsafe-qa <id>` | Generate full QA report with GO/NO-GO recommendation |
| `specsafe-complete <id>` | Complete spec with human approval (QA → COMPLETE) |
| `specsafe-status` | Show project dashboard with all specs and metrics |
| `specsafe-archive <id>` | Archive an obsolete spec with reason |
| `specsafe-doctor` | Validate project health and diagnose issues |
| `specsafe-context` | Gather and present project context for AI agents |
| `specsafe-skill-creator` | Create new SpecSafe skills with proper structure |

## Project Constraints

1. **Always read `PROJECT_STATE.md` first** — before any skill invocation, check current state
2. **Never modify `PROJECT_STATE.md` directly** — only update it through skill workflows
3. **Tests define implementation** — code exists only to make tests pass
4. **One spec at a time** — complete or park a spec before starting another
5. **No stage skipping** — every spec must progress through all 5 development stages in order
6. **Evidence required** — QA verdicts require concrete test evidence, not assertions
7. **Normative language** — specs use SHALL/MUST/SHOULD per RFC 2119
8. **Planning precedes development** — reduce ambiguity before writing code
